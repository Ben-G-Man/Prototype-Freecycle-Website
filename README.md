# Freecycle Website Project

I built this websitefor a third year human computer interaction assignment at The University of Auckland during 2024, hence it was created to be viewed at 1920 x 1080 and encorporate an assigned colour. 
This project demonstrates a number of design and accessability principles, including 'tab navigation' functionality.

**NOTE:** For the best experience view this website at **1920 x 1080** reslution as it is a basic prototype and is **not** responsive.

## What Is Freecycling?

**Freecycling**
To give away (something used or unwanted), as opposed to selling it or throwing it away, especially in an arrangement made via the internet.

## Features

- Custom colour scheme designed to complement the assigned colour (warm purple).
- 'Tab navigation'.
- Contact form meeting the criteria outline in the brief.
- Dummy listing slideshow via JavaScript.
